# JavaScript Course Content

## 1. **JavaScript Programming Language (Core Concepts)**

- **Variables and Memory**  
  Understanding how data is stored in variables and how memory (RAM) is used in JavaScript.
- **Input and Output**  
  How to take user input and display output using methods like `prompt()`, `alert()`, `console.log()`, etc.

- **Data Types**  
  Overview of different data types: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and more.

- **Functions**  
  Writing reusable blocks of code with functions. Understanding function scopes (local vs. global) and function declarations vs. expressions.

- **Operators and Logical Operations**  
  Arithmetic, comparison (`==`, `===`, `>`, `<`), and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).  
  Introduction to truth tables for understanding boolean logic.

- **Control Structures**  
  Decision-making in JavaScript using `if-else`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), and the `break`/`continue` statements.

- **Objects and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  Understanding objects, properties, and methods. Introduction to OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and constructors in JavaScript.

- **Array and String Methods**  
  Working with arrays using methods like `push()`, `pop()`, `slice()`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.  
  String manipulation using methods such as `split()`, `substring()`, `replace()`, and more.

- **Date, Math, and Regular Expressions (RegExp)**  
  Using JavaScript's built-in `Date` and `Math` objects. Introduction to Regular Expressions for pattern matching and data validation.

- **Assignments and Practice Exercises**  
  Regular coding assignments to solidify understanding of core concepts, including building small programs using the above topics.

## 2. **JavaScript in the Browser (DOM Manipulation & Front-End)**

- **The DOM (Document Object Model)**  
  Introduction to the DOM and how browsers represent HTML as a tree structure. Learn to interact with and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript.

- **Selecting and Traversing DOM Elements**  
  Methods for selecting elements (`getElementById`, `querySelector`, `getElementsByClassName`) and traversing the DOM tree.

- **Event Listeners**  
  Understanding how to respond to user actions by attaching event listeners to elements (`click`, `submit`, `change`, `keyup`, etc.).

- **Working with Forms**  
  Handling form inputs, validation, and submitting data using JavaScript.

- **Browser APIs**  
  Introduction to useful browser APIs:

  - `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` for persisting data.
  - `location` and `history` for working with the browser's navigation history.
  - Manipulating URLs, getting geolocation, and handling browser history states.

- **E-commerce Functionality (Mini Projects)**  
  Practical exercises focused on building e-commerce features:
  - **Image switching** for product galleries.
  - **Quantity counters** for adding/removing products in the cart.
  - **Add to Cart functionality** with event handling and data persistence.
  - **Mobile Navigation Menu** for responsive design using JavaScript.

## 3. **JavaScript + Node.js + Express.js (Backend Development)**

- **Introduction to Node.js**  
  Understanding Node.js as a JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications. Learn the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model of Node.js.

- **In-built Node.js Modules**  
  Explore core Node.js modules:

  - **`fs` (File System)**: Reading and writing files.
  - **`os`**: Working with operating system-level data (memory, CPU, etc.).
  - **`path`**: Handling and manipulating file paths.

- **Working with External Modules (Express.js)**  
  Introduction to Express.js for building HTTP servers. Setting up routes, handling requests and responses, and managing middleware.

- **Databases (Overview)**  
  Introduction to working with databases in Node.js (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).  
  Connecting to a database, performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

- **Building REST APIs**  
  Learn how to build a RESTful API using Express.js:

  - Setting up routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - Handling JSON data and interacting with a database.

- **Final Project: Full-Stack Application**  
  A capstone project combining front-end and back-end development:
  - Build a fully functional web application that includes front-end interactions with JavaScript, server-side logic with Node.js/Express, and data persistence using a database.
  - Examples include a simple e-commerce site, a to-do list app, or a blog platform.
